                Today we're passing from the traditional server app with generated with which a user dialogs through
                forms to full front-end applications, in which the server becomes a data persistence structure.

        <h1>This evolution brings many advantages</h1>

        <p>
            Single-page applications offer an experience that is very similar to desktop applications.

        <div class="adv adv-1">
            Screen transitions can be very fast and smooth. The application is way more reactive, and
            everything can be connected.

            Data persistence is well separated from the interface, and if well made
            can be reused in other types of interfaces, like mobile applications.

            This lack of structure can also bring problems when the developer wants to reuse features.

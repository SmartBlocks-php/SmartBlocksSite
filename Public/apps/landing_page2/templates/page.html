                SmartBlocks is a web development framework that helps structuring your front-end, dividing it into
                reusable modules.

                    Screen transitions can be very fast and smooth. The application is way more reactive, and

                    Data persistence is well separated from the interface, and if well made

        <div class="explanation">
            As the app becomes more and more complex, it usually loses code simplicity.

                <p>
                    This lack of structure can also bring problems when the developer wants to reuse features.
                    We find ourselves making copy/paste of small code portions, which is kind of messy.

                    As the app gains features, the front-end code can quickly become unstructured

            <h3>Structure for your apps</h3>
            <p>
                Everything's divided into feature blocks. These blocks are put into a main project structure, which
                brings a back-end environment and a front-end environment.<br/>
                SmartBlocks is based on libraries like Backbone and Require.js.

        <div class="subsection">
            <h3>Better maintainability</h3>
            <p>
                When you want to add features to your web application, just create a new block with its own data, views
                and algorithms.<br/>

            <h3>Reuse and share</h3>
            <p>
                Once you've created your blocks, and worked with them, they can be very easily reused
                in other SmartBlocks projects. You will also be able to share them with the SmartBlocks community by releasing
                them in a Block Store.

                SmartBlocks is a currently an open-source student project. You can start playing with it,
                but don't use it in production as it is still very unstable and subject to many future changes.
